    <p>
        Padar Island is the third largest island in Komodo National Park, after Komodo Island and Rinca Island. Although its name is not as famous as those two islands, its natural beauty is no less captivating. It is located closer to Rinca Island than Komodo Island, separated by the Lintah Strait. The island's unique landscape, with towering hills and winding coastlines, makes it a favorite destination for tourists and photographers.

    <p>
        As part of Komodo National Park, Padar Island is also recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. However, unlike Komodo Island and Rinca Island, this island is not inhabited by Komodo dragons. This is due to a broken food chain, though the island remains an essential part of the area's ecosystem. Around this region, there are several small islands, each offering unique and mesmerizing panoramas. Additionally, the pink sandy beach on this island is a special attraction. This location is perfect for various activities such as swimming, playing in the water, or snorkeling.

        One experience that should not be missed is hiking the island’s hills. From the top, the view of the blue sea combined with the surrounding cluster of islands will mesmerize anyone who sees it. Although the trekking path to the summit is quite challenging, the breathtaking hill landscapes along the way and the stunning panorama at the top make the effort worthwhile. Capturing moments during the journey is always an enjoyable activity.
